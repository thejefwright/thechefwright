          Jef Wright is a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Academy, he has
          worked in a wide array of cuisines and restaurants both large and
          intimate. For many years he worked in Atlanta GA, with Richard Blais,
          Top Chef All-Stars winner, where he focused on "molecular gastronomy"
          as a means to reimagine and refine traditional southern dishes. His
          passion for continued learning has taken him to Philadelphia and New
          York where he worked in both a 2 Michelin star restaurant and for
          several large upscale restaurants. His style is best described as
          heavily influenced by traditional French and Spanish cuisine with a
          love for Southern food, always focusing on refined techniques and
          fresh, local ingredients. Most recently, Jef was Executive Chef
          leading the kitchen at Sur Lie in downtown Portland where he helped to
          successfully guide the restaurant through the pandemic. During the
          pandemic shutdown, partnered with
