  Jef Wright is a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Academy, he has worked in
  a wide array of cuisines and restaurants both large and intimate. For many
  years he worked in Atlanta GA, with Richard Blais, former Top Chef winner, and
  focused on molecular gastronomy as a means to reimagine and refine traditional
  southern dishes. His passion for continued learning has taken him to
  Philadelphia and New York where he worked in both a 2 Michelin star restaurant
  and for a large and well-known upscale restaurant group. His style is best
  described as heavily influenced by traditional French and Spanish cuisine with
  a love for upscale Southern always focusing on refined techniques. He was the
  opening sous chef at The Garrison in Yarmouth, where he helped the restaurant
  attain a 4-Â½ star review from the Press Herald. Jef is thrilled to be stepping
  back into the role of Executive Chef and leading the kitchen at Sur Lie. He
  looks forward to sharing his excitement and passion for delicious,
  sophisticated cuisine with Portland.
